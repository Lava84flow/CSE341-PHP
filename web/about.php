                Hey the 6 people the will see this, My name is Lava84flow (for school purposes, Bryce Dickson) and well, there isn't all that much to me.
                I like me some Vidja Games, and try to stream them when I can. Last place I lived had abysmal up speeds, so that wasn't happening at anything above 480p... which kinda just looks like mud with todays UI's. Should be fine now, once I find my box of cables and get set up again. As for games I like to play the most, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/">Factorio</a> and  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/Borderlands/">Borderlands</a> are always a good time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/Elite_Dangerous/s">Elite Dangerous</a> is one of my favorite simulators, and Pok√©mon is always handy for a bus ride or two. Lately I've been playing the rest of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/FarCry">Far Cry</a> games besides 5 (Cause I beat it like 3 times). Well, that and <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/">Fallout 76</a> with some punks I know. I know the rest of the Internet seems to hate it, but I like it somewhat.

                That's pretty much it, Games and Coding. Now that I remind myself, I do dabble in 3d-Printing every now and then when I get around to buying more Filament and actually remember to re-lube, re-align and re-calibrate my printer. Oh yeah, before I forget, here's a link to my channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeBy3MdNORYLJm9RlzOxDjw">Lava84flow</a>
